# VIT BFHL Task API

This repository contains a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. 

The API accepts a POST request at /bfhl with an array input and returns data separated into even numbers, odd numbers, uppercase alphabets, special characters, sum of numbers as a string, and a concatenated string of alphabets in reverse alternating caps. 

The API also includes user details such as user_id, email, and college roll number following the specified format.

This project demonstrates basic REST API development, data processing, and deployment on Vercel.
